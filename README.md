This repo holds my ideal environmental set up.

If you decide to use it on a new system, be sure to install tmux first, then, run the .setup script.
It'll back up your existing bashrc and vim files, then it'll symlink the files accordingly.

Open VIM and then run :PluginInstall

This will setup all your VIM configs.

Enjoy!
