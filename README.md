# my_env
# ======

This repo holds my ideal environmental set up.

If you decide to use it on a new system, be sure to do the following in order:
 - install git
 - install tmux
 - install vim
 - run the .setup script [./.setup]

It'll back up your existing bashrc and vim files, if there are any, then it'll symlink the files accordingly.

Open VIM and then run :PluginInstall

This will setup all your VIM configs.

Enjoy!
